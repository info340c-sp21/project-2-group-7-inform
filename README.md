**Problem Domain**

The iSchool's unique concentrations allow for students to pursue different fields that they are interested in. However, when it comes to planning for what courses to take, specifically planning for courses to complete a concentration, the process becomes convoluted, difficult, and an overall inconvenience. Currently, Informatics course planning information is spread throughout a variety of different webpages, rather than an all in one webpage. An example of this is the pre-approved courses webpage as well as the projected courses schedule. The lack of color coded labels by concentration or the ability to dynamically filter courses by its information makes course planning a tedious process. Although there are current existing course planning applications such as MyPlan which offer features such as course planning and degree auditing, it fails to take into account projected course offerings, alternative pre-approved-courses, filtering by concentration, course evaluations, and recommended course plans.

**App Description**

Our proposed application is a web app that allows Informatics students to view both Informatics and pre-approved courses in a dynamic and easily accessible way. The primary users of this application would be prospective and current students majoring or minoring in Informatics. I also hope that this web app can also be used by the Informatics academic advisors to help students make their academic plans and to also consolidate all course planning resources into one application. The Information users will be viewing will be an amalgamation of data from: 

* [Information School Course Descriptions](https://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/info.html)
* [Projected and Current Course Time Schedules](https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/informatics/curriculum/course-schedules/info-projected)
* [Informatics pre-approved course electives](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1090264/pages/pre-approved-courses)
